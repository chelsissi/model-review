Model - Linear Regression

  * independent variable (predict variable, regressor)

  * dependent variable (the event studied)

  * definition: modelling the relationship between a dependent variable and 1 or more explanatory variables.
  
    1. 1 explanatory variable: simple linear regression
    2. more than 1 expanatory variable: multiple linear regression

  Note: the difference between _multiple linear regression_ and _multi\-variable linear regression_ is that the former have 
  **multiple explanatory variables**, while the later one have **multiple correlated dependent variables**.
